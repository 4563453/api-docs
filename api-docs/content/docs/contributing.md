## Contributing to the API Docs.
 
Anyone can contribute to the docs. We only ask that you follow a few guidelines when contributing.

1. **Follow the file structure.**  Each topic (or sub-topic) has language specific folders and a basic guide. Inside each language folder there should be a tutorial and a code file if applicable. 
*You do not need to tackle an entire topic by yourself.* Completing even one tutorial is helpful!
2. **Follow the tutorial structure.** Try to keep each tutorial as objective as possible. You can have some personal expression but try to keep it limited. We want these guides to be as short and as simple as they can get. The tutorial should be written in [Markdown](https://stackedit.io/).  Explain every step and clearly document any code used. **Don't** do [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAlSjtxy5ak).
3. **Run any code through a prettier software.**  Try to keep the code looking nice! It doesn't matter which formatter you use but we want the code to be readable.

4. **Follow the Glimesh and Github TOS (Terms of Service).** Any tutorial that violates either of the TOS will be removed. Any malicious code will be removed.

## Process

Fork the repository.  Create an issue if you have any questions.  When you have made your changes submit a pull request with a brief overview of your tutorial/topic. 

We may ask you to make changes. Once accepted your changes will be added to the docs. Thank you for contributing!
