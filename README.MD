# Welcome

This is the repo hosting all of the Glimesh Developer docs. We have separated the topics into language specific guides (Node,Python,C,etc). Each topic also has a file explaining the basics of the spec. If you have any questions let us know in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Glimesh)!

It is recomended to view the docs on our [website](https://glimesh.github.io/api-docs/)

## Structure

This repo is divided into topics. Each topic has a tutorial for each language as they are added. The tutorial contains a full guide explaining the topic as basic as possible. Code snippets are included as well as a working example upon completion of the tutorial. In addition to the tutorials a basic spec is added. This does not have any code and is intended so languages without tutorials can still access the Glimesh service.

This repo is a work in progress. We will do our best to keep this updated!
